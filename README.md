# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

*coding performed by Dennis A. Johns*

The Move Trailer Website project is the first project assigned for Udacity's Full Stack Web Devloper nanodegree!

# What is this project, anyhow?

The Full Stack Web Developer Movie Trailer project allows the user to view a webpage with a list of the developers favorite movies, which includes the movie title, tagline, movie poster, and allows the user to view the movies trailer!

# Requirements to run the website

Before the user can view the website, there are a few things to be done first:
- You'll need to download Python 2.x
- Once Python is downloaded, make sure Python is added to the system path

# Now that Python is loaded...

You'll need the project files loaded onto your computer
- Download the zip file containing the project files
- Unzip the project files to a directory of your choice
- Open up the operating systems command prompt
- Change directory to the location of the unzipped files
- From the operating system command prompt, type *Python entertainment_center.py* 
```
The Movie Trailer Website should now be displayed as "Dennis' Five Star Movies!"
```
